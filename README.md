# Simple-guessing-game-using-while-loop-in-python
In this game we are going to use while loop for guessing a random number

The while in loop in python is used to execute a code block multiple times. They are often used in building interactive games and programs.

In this code we are going to create a guessing game that will return a congratulatory message to the user after making a correct guess. we will use while loop for creating this program.

CODE EXPLAINATION:

letâ€™s start by giving a input in the given code by a secret number and we are creating a variables in first three lines. Then we are using while loop by giving a condition that the variables guess_count should be less than the variable guess_limit. In other words the user has to make a guess that should not exceed 3. we request the user input the correct guess and then we convert it to a integer . we will increment the value by guess_count by 1. we are using if statement within the loop stating that the user a correct guess that is equal to the secret_number. we will display the congratulatory message if the condition is true and we are using break keyword to terminate the loop . Atlast we are using the else statement to return another output if the conditions in the if statement and while statement are not met,or they are false and then we will display the result by printing that U have failed.
